Hi everyone, this is the project that I use mobile sale dataset taken from kaggle to analyze. Please have a look and give me comments for construction! Thanks everyone!

*Important note: As I use plotly to draw charts so all those charts are not shown in the 'Mobile Sales.ipynb'. Thus, please check this link from Jupiter Notebook to have a look with the code file and all the charts. You just paste the link of Mobile Sales.ipynb to the link below, then the comprehensive view of my notebook will be shown! https://nbviewer.org/

Please have a look!
